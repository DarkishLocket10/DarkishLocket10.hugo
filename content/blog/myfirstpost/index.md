My journey as a computer scientist may just be getting started. Still, I am learning so many things, and I expect to constantly pick up so much information along the way. I am proud of where I am, and I am incredibly proud of every single person I meet. Whoever is reading this, make sure you take a deep breath and give yourself a pat on the back because you are amazing.

I will edit this soon; I haven't slept in a while lol.

Enjoy this photo I took from the top of my apartment building! I used my new 100-300 micro 4/3 lens :P
