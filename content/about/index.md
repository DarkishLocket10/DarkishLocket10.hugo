Hey! My name is Yash Patel. I am a student at Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, studying Computer Science. My goal is to graduate with a Specialization in Software Development with a focus in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Economics!

I have a few hobbies and interests, which include:
- [Photography](/projects/personal-photography/)
- Games, whether physical or in the digital medium
- Filmography and good old fashioned movie watching :)
- Music (especially woodwinds like the clarinet and also saxophone)
- Technology, whether it's keeping up with what's going on in the world of tech or building devices like robots and computers.
